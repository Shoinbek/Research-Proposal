# Research-Proposal: "The impact of changes in the frequency of small's shop's analysis of customer data on their profitability"
The goal of this study is to determine whether there is a connection between the regularity with which small shops analyze consumer data and their ability to turn a profit in the very competitive US retail sector. 
The main goal of the study is to determine how frequently analyzing consumer data affects the profitability of small retail stores in big metropolitan cities such as Kansas City and Saint Lois. 
A correlational research design will be used in the study to accomplish this goal, and data from a sample of 70 small retail shop owners who have been in operation for about 6-7 years will be collected.
